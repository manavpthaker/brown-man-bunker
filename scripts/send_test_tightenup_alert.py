============================================
PHASE RECOMMENDATIONS
============================================

Based on current threat levels, review preparedness phases:

Phase 0-3: IMMEDIATE PRIORITY
- Foundations and 72-hour readiness
- Communications and digital resilience
- Health and mobile communications

Phase 4-6: NEXT 7 DAYS (if conditions persist)
- Basement/shelter preparations
- Generator readiness
- Enhanced physical security

Phase 7-9: EVALUATE NEED
- Based on threat evolution
- Consult local conditions
- Community coordination

============================================
WHY THIS MATTERS
============================================

Multiple red indicators suggest:
‚Ä¢ Financial system stress (Treasury, mBridge)
‚Ä¢ Social/migration pressures (ICE capacity)
‚Ä¢ Potential for cascading effects

This is NOT a drill. The confluence of these indicators
warrants immediate preparedness actions.

============================================
NEXT SYSTEM ACTIONS
============================================

‚Ä¢ Monitoring frequency increased to every 15 minutes
‚Ä¢ Next alert only if conditions change significantly
‚Ä¢ Daily summary at 8 AM unless urgent changes

Stay prepared, stay calm, stay informed.
