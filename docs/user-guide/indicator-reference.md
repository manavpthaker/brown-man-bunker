- Supply chain (2+ amber) = Shortages imminent
- Energy (2+ amber) = Infrastructure stress

### Regional Variations

Some indicators vary by location:
- Natural gas prices differ by region
- ICU capacity is county-specific
- Unemployment uses metro area data

## Using This Information

### Daily Monitoring
