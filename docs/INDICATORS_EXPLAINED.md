- Continue regular routines

### ðŸŸ¡ AMBER - Elevated
- Pay attention to this indicator
- Consider topping off supplies
- Monitor news for context

### ðŸ”´ RED - Critical
- This indicator shows serious stress
- If 2+ indicators are red = TIGHTEN-UP alert

## The TIGHTEN-UP Protocol

When ANY 2 indicators hit RED simultaneously:

2. **Power & Comms** (12 hours)
   - Charge everything

## Indicator Combinations to Watch

### "Financial Meltdown" Pattern
- Treasury Stress + Luxury Collapse + mBridge = Banking crisis likely

### "Supply Chain Collapse" Pattern
- Taiwan Activity + Hormuz Risk + School Closures = Empty shelves coming

### "Social Breakdown" Pattern
- ICE Detention + Jobless Claims + Pharmacy Shortage = Civil unrest risk

### "Black Swan" Pattern
- DoD Autonomy + Any 2 others = Unpredictable cascading crisis
