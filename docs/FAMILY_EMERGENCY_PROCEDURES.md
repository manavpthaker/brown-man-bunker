## Understanding the Monitoring System

Our household uses an automated system that tracks 6 critical indicators:

1. **Treasury Market Stress** - Financial system stability
2. **ICE Detention Capacity** - Social/migration pressures
3. **Taiwan Strait Activity** - Geopolitical tensions
4. **Hormuz Shipping Risk** - Energy supply threats
5. **DoD Autonomy Systems** - Military technology shifts
6. **mBridge Settlements** - Dollar alternative usage

The system checks these every hour and sends alerts if 2+ indicators hit red status.

## Age-Appropriate Explanations

### For Young Children (5-10):
"Our family has a special computer helper that watches for times when we need to be extra prepared, like checking the weather for storms. When it tells us, we make sure we have flashlights, water, and snacks ready, just like camping!"

### For Tweens/Teens (11-17):
"We use a monitoring system that tracks various global indicators - like financial markets and international tensions. When multiple indicators suggest increased risk, we get an alert to top off our emergency supplies. It's like having a sophisticated early warning system."

### For Elderly Family Members:
"This is similar to how we used to prepare for winter storms or hurricanes, but instead of watching just weather, we're watching several global conditions that might affect supply chains or infrastructure."
